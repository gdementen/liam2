# This monkey-patches larray to allow targeting a boolean axis of an array using a boolean array because this is
# currently a very common use case in LIAM2: when we have a global array with a True/False gender axis, and we want
# to get the value of that array for all individuals depending on their gender.

# This is ugly but I consider this is the lesser evil. If we did not do this, it would require users to systematically
# specify the axis explicitly: global_array[X.gender[gender]] instead of global_array[gender]
# See https://github.com/larray-project/larray/issues/794#issuecomment-547974634 for details.

# Note that the only other practical option at this point was to make a local copy of the whole larray library,
# but in that case it is a lot less clear what is actually changed.

# The cleanest option would have been to define our own AxisCollection variant inheriting from la.AxisCollection but
# this would not work in the current version of larray as any operation on a LIAM2AxisCollection would return an
# AxisCollection and not its LIAM2 subclass. Also, the la.Array class uses AxisCollection explicitly and there is no
# mechanism to customize that (and I don't think it is worth the trouble at this point to implement such a mechanism),
# so we would have to basically re-implement the whole library

# Now the real, future-proof solution is to implement support for categoricals, so that we can have expressions like:
# where(gender == 'male', age * 5.1, age * 5.2)
# we are not there yet though.

# For some cases, it would be even better to encourage our users to avoid using constants in their code but rather
# use many (possibly autoindexed) array constants. I am unsure it would solve all cases of where(gender, ...) though.
